## About Me

Hey there! 👋 I'm Heshan, a student at IMC Krems, diving into the world of informatics. While I’m still exploring what I want to specialize in, software engineering has been an exciting journey so far. I enjoy solving problems with code and building things that make life a little easier (and a lot cooler).

When I'm not coding, I love spending time outdoors, traveling, or kicking back with a good movie. Life’s about learning and enjoying the ride, one step at a time!
